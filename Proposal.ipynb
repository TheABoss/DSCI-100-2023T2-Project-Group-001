    " Being able to predict a given student’s knowledge level in a given subject is of pedagogical importance, as it would allow an instructor to identify students who are in need of additional assistance. Subsequently, our project attempts to build a classifier for a student’s level of knowledge utilizing their performance and their study habits in a current subject and its prerequisite subjects. To accomplish this, our project utilizes the “User Knowledge Modeling” dataset sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. This data set contains the variables STG, SCG, STR, LPR, PEG, and UNS. User knowledge (UNS) is classified as either “very low”, “low”, “middle”, or “high”. STG and STR are the normalized study times for current material and prerequisite material respectively. PEG is performance on exams for the current subject. SCG is the extent of repetition undergone by that student for the current subject. Finally, LPR is the student’s knowledge in the prerequisite courses. These variables (STG, SCG, STR, LPR, PEG) are normalized and scaled from 0 to 1, and come pre-split into training and test data sets. "

    "To conduct our analysis, we will create a classifier utilizing the K nearest neighbours (KNN) model. The predictors for this model will be STG, SCG, STR, and PEG. We selected these predictors based on the above graph as they show a somewhat increasing trend as knowledge level changes from “very low” to “low” to “middle” to “high”. Continuing on this logic, LPR does not appear to have the same trend, as the average values for “very low” and “middle” observations are similar, as are the ones for “low” and “high”. In other words, LPR values do not seem to be able to predict knowledge class based on the graph. Thus, we are excluding LPR as one of our predictors.  We will show the results of our analysis through two graphs: one which shows a line graph of the predicted accuracy with different values of k, and a confusion matrix for the final classifier against the test data."
